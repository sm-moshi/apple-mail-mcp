## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **IMAP-based inbox sorting** (`sort_inbox`): Sort emails into folders using IMAP with Proton Bridge support (SSL/STARTTLS/plain fallback)
- **IMAP bulk move** (`imap_bulk_move`): Batch move emails between IMAP folders with RFC 6851 MOVE support
- **Bulk move emails** (`bulk_move_emails`): AppleScript-based bulk move for folder merging and inbox triage

- **CLAUDE.md**: Project instructions for Claude Code with architecture docs and development patterns

### Changed
- **Modular package refactoring**: Split monolithic `apple_mail_mcp.py` into `apple_mail_mcp/` package with `server.py`, `core.py`, `constants.py`, `imap.py`, and `tools/` submodules
- **Core hardened**: Deduplicated AppleScript helpers into `core.py` (`get_mailbox_script()`, `recipients_script()`, `inbox_mailbox_script()`, `date_cutoff_script()`, `content_preview_script()`, `skip_folders_condition()`)
- **Migrated to `pyproject.toml` + `uv sync`** from `requirements.txt`

### Fixed
- IMAP modified UTF-7 encoding for international mailbox names

- **`inbox_dashboard`**: Interactive UI dashboard resource for compatible MCP clients (requires `mcp-ui-server`)

### Changed
- AppleScript execution now uses **stdin pipe** (`osascript -` with `subprocess.run(input=...)`) instead of `-e` flag, fixing reliability issues with multi-line scripts and special characters
- Improved error surfacing: AppleScript stderr is now properly captured and raised
- Tool count updated to 26 (from 25)
